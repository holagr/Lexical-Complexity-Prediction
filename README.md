Predicting the lexical complexity of Single words.

SemEval Task 1 - Lexical Complexity Prediction (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02340)

Lexical complexity plays an important role in reading comprehension. Predicting lexical complexity accurately can enable a system to better guide a user to an appropriate text. NLP systems have been developed to simplify texts for second language learners, native speakers with low literacy levels, and people with reading disabilities.


## Run the code (Using Google Colab Notebook)

* Our model for lexical complexity prediction can also be run following the instructions in [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eOBl3uR874tt3IMQKEXPIRNCMdRmcCsy) Colab Notebook

* Go to the Runtime tab above and select Run all. This will run the whole notebook and the results can be seen in the end cells

## Experiments
* We also experimented with the task using BERT transformer model in [this](https://colab.research.google.com/github/suryasuresh91/Lexical-Complexity-Prediction/blob/main/LCP_BERT.ipynb) Colab Notebook

* Note: This code (Transformer Model) may take a significant amount of time to run (in the order of hours)
